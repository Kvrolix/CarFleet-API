// Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next. and it is used to be placed in the stack
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to add data to the body

app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/public`)); // Middleware to serve static files from the public folder, with this option i can openany file in the public folder, like index.html, css, js, etc. and it will be served as a static file. The __dirname variable is a global variable that contains the path to the current directory, so we are using it to create the path to the public folder.

// carRouter;

module.exports = app; // Export the app object so it can be used in other files
